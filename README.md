The Sorting Visualizer project is a program that allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides a graphical representation of how different sorting algorithms work and how they rearrange elements in a list to achieve a sorted order. This README file will guide you through the project and explain how to set it up and use it effectively.

Features
Visualization of popular sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.

Real-time visualization of the sorting process with colored bars representing the elements.
